# MOTH
I’m opening this space to turn my short piece for two saxophones, titled “MOTH”, into an open collective work. I’m inviting composers, sound artists, media artists and any other creative mind to join in and take anything from my score, recordings and notes: remix it, build anything upon it or from any part of it.
